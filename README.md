# WSDL_Listen.java
This ImageJ plugin is useful for creating an image reading app for radiology or ultrasound image reading. The plugin simply 'listens' to changes in output from a web service that  prints a list of image URLs. The plugin will automatically load images from the web service. The source code for the plugin contains more information on the uses and instructions for installing in ImageJ.

# imageUrlList.text
This is a sample text file that acts as a dummy web service for the WSDL_Listen.java plugin. This repo does not delve into creating a web service or server to serve up a dynamically generated list of images to load into ImageJ.
